# COVID-19 Data Exploration using SQL

This project explores COVID-19 data using SQL queries to analyze various aspects, such as total cases, death rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress worldwide.

## üìå Overview
The dataset used in this project contains COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination records from various countries. The goal is to extract meaningful insights by applying SQL queries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **SQL** (for data analysis)
- **SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL** (depending on your setup)
- **Jupyter Notebook (Optional, for visualization)**

## üìÇ Dataset
The data used in this project comes from the COVID-19 dataset, which includes:
- **COVID-19 Cases & Deaths** (`CovidDeaths`)
- **COVID-19 Vaccinations** (`CovidVaccinations`)

## üìä SQL Queries & Analysis

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Data Exploration
- Selecting relevant fields from the dataset
- Filtering data for specific locations

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Case Fatality Rate Analysis
- Calculating the likelihood of dying if infected with COVID-19
- Finding infection rate per country

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Highest Infection & Death Rate
- Identifying countries with the highest infection rate
- Comparing infection rates across continents

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Global Statistics
- Total cases and deaths worldwide
- Calculating global death percentage

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Vaccination Analysis
- Comparing total population vs vaccinated individuals
- Using **Window Functions (SUM OVER PARTITION BY)** to track cumulative vaccinations
- Using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for population vaccination analysis
- Storing results in a **temporary table** and a **view** for easier visualization

## üìú SQL Queries
The SQL scripts used in this project can be found in [`Project1_COVID.sql`](Project1_COVID.sql). These queries cover:
- Case & death analysis
- Infection rate comparison
- Vaccination tracking using **CTE, Temp Tables, and Views**
